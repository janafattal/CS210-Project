# DSA210-Project


**Project Overview**

The idea of my project is to focus on analyzing the performance and engagement metrics of my TikTok account (@studylabaii) that I manage as part of a social media marketing campaign. By studying content trends, audience behavior, and engagement patterns, the project aims to provide more insights to improve marketing strategies and maximize the account's reach.
