# CS210-Project

The idea of my project is to analyze my Tiktok data from my account (@studylabaii), which focuses on advertising and promoting the website studylabai.com. I am going to to compare the effectiveness of different types of content and strategies, to see which drives in more traffic and engagement to the StudyLabAI website. The aim is to see which Tiktok content strategy (content type, posting time, hashtags, etc.) increases the website's users the most.
